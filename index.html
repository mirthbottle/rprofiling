Based on this fact, it is widely believed that black people simply commit more crimes than white people*.  On its face, racial profiling seems like an efficient way to catch criminals.  However, to rephrase the obvious, racial profiling really just means that you will catch a <strong>higher percentage</strong> of the black criminals, causing them to be overly represented among the criminals that you catch.  This is an attempt to demonstrate that the results tend to reinforce prejudices (because human beings are not good at reasoning about probability and cause).</h3>

This result shows that even without confirmation bias, which we all have, we are likely to believe things that aren't true simply because we are <strong>also</strong> bad at reasoning about probability.</h3>

<li>I'm going to show that it doesn't really matter whether it is true or not true.  If it's not true, racial profiling will make it seem true.  If it is true, racial profiling will make it seem even more true.</li>
